QUESTION 1: Why is String[] args changed to a LinkedList in WordSearch.main? (Hint: Examine the WordSearch constructor!)


String[] args is changed to LinkedList in WordSearch.main because, unlike arrays, LinkedList can be dynamic meaning it can grow or shrink so it is not fixed which makes it an efficient choice. String[] args is only sufficient if you need to access an element by an index but if you're going to need to frequently add or remove elements then a LinkedList is preferred.



QUESTION 2: How many puzzles did your machine need to solve with 1 thread to run for between 30 and 45 seconds: 


With 1 thread, my machine needs 700 puzzles to run between 30 and 45 seconds (exact runtime is between 33-35 seconds).



QUESTION 3: Provide the output of 

    time java WordSearch n 1000 ../puzzle??.txt 

where n is 1 to 16 and 1000 is the number of puzzles specified in Question 2. NOTE: You can run all of these with a single bash command if you like (again, replace 1000 with your number of puzzles from Question 2):

for i in {1..16} ; do time java WordSearch $i 1000 ../puzzle??.txt ; done

Example Timing:

 for i in {1..16} ; do time java WordSearch $i 1000 ../puzzle??.txt ; done

QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program even slightly?  Why or why not?


Adding more threads does not continue to speed up the program. In fact, adding more threads slows the program down slightly. Above I ran 1000 puzzles with 1, 3, and 16 threads and got a runtime of 0m45.753s, 0m45.399s, and 0m45.303s respectively. This provides evidence for my previous statement because the program gradually had a slower runtime with each thread added. I believe this is because there is no thread pool. Without a thread pool there is not an efficient way to share data between threads. Mechanisms such as synchronization and mutex ensure thread safety which can impact performance and efficiency. So without a thread pool that has those mechanisms, multiple threads won't make a significant difference in the runtime of a program.



QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load" (sys), or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?


Adding more threads increases the "system load" (sys) up slightly. It does not stay constant regardless of the number of threads. Above I ran 1000 puzzles with 1, 3, and 16 threads and got a system load (sys) of 0m0.256s, 0m0.310s, and 0m0.333s respectively. This is because we are running a multi-threaded program without a thread pool. The system load reflects the amount of work that the CPU handles and if we create more threads without proper management it can lead to an increased CPU load which causes an increase in system load.

YOUR Timing:


time java WordSearch 1 1000 ../puzzle??.txt

time java WordSearch 16 1000 ../puzzle??.txt

real	0m49.282s
user	0m51.337s

QUESTION 6: Is a thread pool faster, slower, or roughly equivalent in performance? 


It's hard to say for sure if a thread pool is faster, slower, or roughly equivalent in performance because I believe it's based on multiple factors. Obviously a well-designed high-level working thread pool would be faster or at least equivalent in performance to a manually created thread but in my case it was slower. 1 thread for 1000 puzzles in my full credit code ran in 0m45.753s while 1 thread for 1000 puzzles in my bonus code ran in 0m50.626s. In this instance the thread pool was slower in performance but I believe that it varies from situation to situation.



QUESTION 7: Compare your full credit and bonus solution code. Which do you believe is more supportable over a long lifetime of evolving hardware and environments?


I believe that my bonus solution code is more supportable over a long lifetime of evolving hardware and environments because as Java and hardware evolve it is usually easier to adapt code that has high-level abstractions such as the thread pool I implemented in my bonus code.
